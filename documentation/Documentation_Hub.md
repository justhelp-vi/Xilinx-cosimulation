# 📚 Xilinx Co-Simulation Documentation Hub

Welcome to the central knowledge base for the QEMU + SystemC + Verilator project. Use the guides below to navigate the architecture, setup, and extension of the platform.

## 🏁 Start Here
*   **[Project Master Guide](file:///home/testuser/Qemu/documentation/Project_Master_Guide.md)**: The "Single Source of Truth." If you are an absolute beginner, start here for copy-paste commands to get the simulator running. (Includes the **Zynq-7000 Simplified Path**).
*   **[Getting Started Guide](file:///home/testuser/Qemu/documentation/getting_started.md)**: A concise replication manual for setting up the environment on a new machine.
